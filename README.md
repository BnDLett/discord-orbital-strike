# Discord orbital strike
A Python program that makes a Discord bot do an orbital strike upon a server. <br>
Please do not use this bot for malicious purposes. I intend for this to be used purely only for good. <br>

That includes but is not limited to:
1. A cest pool server filled with absolutely disgusting filth of humans
2. An overly abusive server that believes they're on top of the world
3. Scam/fraud servers

That excluses but is not limited to:
1. Servers truthfully dedicated to helping improve the mental health of others.
2. Regular communities that is just meant for conversation.
3. Fan servers (for example: fans of DanTDM, Hilzu, or even an animation studio)
4. Awareness servers that is meant to spread awareness about scamming and fraud, or just generally learning how to better combat them.

In general, any innocent servers where most of the members are minding their own business should be left alone and not touched by this bot. However any servers that are dedicated to self-importance, abuse, or even just con/deception. <br><br>

To use this bot, you need to replace `"TOKEN"` with your bots token. As for whitelisting yourself or a friend then put yours/their ID in the "AUTHORIZED_USERS" list. <br>
Contact me at "bndlett" on Discord if you require further assistance.<br>
Do note that for this to work entirely, your bot needs the following permissions:
1. Ban members
2. Create channels (optional)
3. Delete channels
4. Send messages (optional)
5. @everyone mention (optional)

Every permissions without a `(optional)` next to it is <b>required</b> for the bot to work entirely as intended.
